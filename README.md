## 💡 About Me

* 🔭 Currently building and fine-tuning models in:

  * 🧠 **LLMs** | 🗣️ **NLP** | 🎯 **Computer Vision**
  * ⚙️ **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** with Transformers
  * 📊 **Custom Object Detectors** | **Facial & Human Action Recognition**
* 🌐 Exploring the **MERN Stack** and leveling up my **web dev game**
* 📚 Deep diving into **Data Structures & Algorithms** with C++ for that extra edge

## 🧠 Philosophy

> "I don’t just learn — I backprop through life."
> "I’m pretrained on hustle, fine-tuned on purpose."
>
> "Every epoch makes me better"\\

## 💬 Bonus Quotes for the Real Ones:

>        
>
> * Every loss is just another gradient to descend
> * I'm pretrained on red flags — I detect 'em in one shot
> * YOLO? Nah. I detect chances in one shot
> * Got 99 problems but vanishing gradients ain’t one
> * Drop the past like a residual — I skip connections to the future
> * I backpropagate through failures and optimize for growth
> * Overfitting? Nah, I’m just deeply trained
> * Even the best models carry some bias — so do we
